We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth.

Engenheiros de Software precisam garantir que o produto seja atual e apelativo, tanto para o contratante quanto para o usuário final. Para alcançar esse objetivo eles trabalham sempre conciliando tempo e o tamanho do projeto, preocupando-se então com a necessidade de atualizações no software durante e após seu período de desenvolvimento.

Within Google, we sometimes say, “Software engineering is programming integrated over time.” Programming is certainly a significant part of software engineering: after all, programming is how you generate new software in the first place. If you accept this distinction, it also becomes clear that we might need to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance). The addition of time adds an important new dimension to programming. Cubes aren’t squares, distance isn’t velocity. Software engineering isn’t programming.

Pode-se dizer que engenharia de software é a programação associada ao tempo, ainda assim a programação é parte essencial da engenharia de software porque no fim das contas trata-se de desenvolver a aplicação em si.
