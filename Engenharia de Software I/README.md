We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth.

Engenheiros de Software precisam garantir que o produto final seja atual e apelativo tanto para o contratante quanto para o usuário final. Para alcançar esse objetivo eles trabalham sempre conciliando tempo e o tamanho do projeto, preocupando-se então com a passagem do tempo e a necessidade de atualizações no software.
